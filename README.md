"# OpenAI-Gym-Models" 

You must have <code>gym</code> installed on your machine to run these models.

The following algorithms have been implemented: SARSA, n-step SARSA, Q-learning, and Deep Q-learning.
For reference about these algorithms, my source was Sutton and Barro's [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](http://incompleteideas.net/book/bookdraft2017nov5.pdf)

These models took a few hours to train using a single GPU on Google Colab
